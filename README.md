 ## 01. Order cache

### 01.01. Task is to implement an in-memory cache of order objects


### 01.02. Provide an implementation for the OrderCacheInterface class in OrderCache.h

 - [x] Due to the simple definitions of the 'Order' and 'OrderCacheInterface' classes at this stage,
    it is not necessary to separate the header files of these classes.

### 01.03. There are more comments in OrderCache.h to provide additional guidance


### 01.04. Submit all files as email attachments or as .zip file

 - [x] the solution to the task is placed on the repo, for obvious reasons

### 01.05. I highly recommend you run various tests yourself for verification
